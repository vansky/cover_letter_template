# Cover Letter Template

This is a LaTeX template for generating cover letters on university letterhead

To use this template, you need to get an approved logo for your university. Often, you must be affiliated with a university to access their logo files. 

* Search for the desired university's branding site. For example, Cornell branding can be found [here](https://brand.cornell.edu/downloads/)
* Download the logo that the university approves for branding. Universities are very particular about their branding, so be sure to read over the requirements for which logos to use and the spacing requirements

This template is a combination of the grant template created by John Stevenson available [here](http://all-geo.org/volcan01010/2013/07/grant-applications-are-hard-work-includes-latex-template), and a LaTeX letterhead template created at Ohio State University. If someone knows who created the original letterhead template, please let me know so I can credit them.
