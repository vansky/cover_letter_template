# Cover/Recommendation Letter Template

This is a LaTeX template for generating cover letters (or recommendation letters) on university letterhead.

To use this template, you need to get an approved logo for your university. Often, you must be affiliated with a university to access their logo files. 

* Search for the desired university's branding site
* Download the logo that the university approves for branding. Universities are very particular about their branding, so be sure to read over the requirements for which logos to use and the spacing requirements
* Insert the logo graphic into `letterhead.cls`
* Modify the `TO FILL` lines in each file as desired 

This is modified from an original LaTeX letterhead template that I believe was created at The Ohio State University. At least it was widely shared there. If someone knows who created the original letterhead template, please let me know so I can credit them.

The spacing tweaks in this template come from the grant template created by John A Stevenson available [here](http://all-geo.org/volcan01010/2013/07/grant-applications-are-hard-work-includes-latex-template).
